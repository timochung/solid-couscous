Test of sample code:

```
import os
import dotenv
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# 加载环境变量
dotenv.load_dotenv()

# 从环境变量中获取 Azure OpenAI 相关信息
aoai_endpoint = os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT')
aoai_key = os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY')
aoai_version = os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_VERSION')

# 初始化 Azure OpenAI 客户端
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=aoai_endpoint,
    api_key=aoai_key,
    api_version=aoai_version
)
```

Our Product
Our product, Automated Repository Management, streamlines software repository tasks. Leveraging advanced language modelling, it automates code organisation, dependency management, and version control. Developers benefit from reduced manual effort, fewer errors, and increased productivity.

Developer Interaction
Developers interact with the system through GitHub’s interface or the command line.

Input Analysis
The system receives input from users, such as code files, documentation, information, etc.

Language Modelling
Advanced language modelling techniques analyze the input data to understand its meaning and relationships.

Task Automation
Based on analysis results, the system automatically performs various tasks, such as code analysis and translation of documentation.

Output Generation
The system generates processed code files, updated dependency lists, and other outputs.

Feedback & Adjustment
Users review and adjust the system-generated output to ensure it meets the expected results.

Repository Update
Once confirmed, the system automatically syncs the updated content to the code repository.

Iterative Process
This process can iterate to handle continuously changing code and dependency relationships.

Co-Operator Workflow
Co-Operator works on another branch, mirroring the main branch. It makes pull requests with documentation translations/code suggestions for developers to approve before merging.
